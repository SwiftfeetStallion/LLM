[edit] Parameters





 value



 -



 the value to be copied



[edit] Return value

A decayed copy of value as a prvalue.



[edit] Notes

decay-copy was introduced by the resolution of LWG issue 929. It is initially used in the concurrency support library to ensure that arguments are decayed when passing-by-value, and is later used in the ranges library.

The language feature auto(x) introduced in C++23 also allows decayed copies to be created as prvalues. The only difference is that decay-copy always materializes value and produces a copy, while auto(expr) is a no-op if expr is a prvalue.

All usages of decay-copy in the standard library (see below) except views::all, ranges::take_view and ranges::drop_view are replaced with auto(x) since C++23.
