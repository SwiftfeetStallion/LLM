void resize( size_type count );

 (1)

(constexpr since C++26)





void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value );

 (2)

(constexpr since C++26)







Resizes the container to contain count elements:



 If count is equal to the current size, does nothing.

 If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to its first count elements.

 If the current size is less than count, then:



1) Additional copies of T()(until C++11)default-inserted elements(since C++11) are appended.

2) Additional copies of value are appended.

[edit] Parameters





 count



 -



 new size of the container





 value



 -



 the value to initialize the new elements with





 Type requirements





 -



If the following condition is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:



1) T is not DefaultInsertable or MoveInsertable into deque.

2) T is not CopyInsertable into deque.



(since C++11)





[edit] Complexity

Linear in the difference between the current size and count. 



 Notes

If value-initialization in overload (1) is undesirable, for example, if the elements are of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it can be avoided by providing a custom Allocator::construct.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <deque>

#include <iostream>

 

void print(auto rem, const std::deque<int>& c)

{

    for (std::cout << rem; const int el : c)

        std::cout << el << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

}

 

int main()

{

    std::deque<int> c = {1, 2, 3};

    print("The deque holds: ", c);

 

    c.resize(5);

    print("After resize up to 5: ", c);

 

    c.resize(2);

    print("After resize down to 2: ", c);

 

    c.resize(6, 4);

    print("After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): ", c);

}

Output:



The deque holds: 1 2 3

After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0

After resize down to 2: 1 2

After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4

LWG 2160



C++11



elements were removed by using pop_back()[2]due to the resolution of LWG 2033



does not specify the methodof removing elements





↑ erase() can remove elements in the middle of a deque, so the value type is required to be MoveAssignable so that the elements following the removed section can be moved forward to fill the gap. However, resize() can only remove elements at the end of the deque, making the MoveAssignable unnecessary.



↑ Removing elements by using pop_back() implies that the elements are required to be removed from back to front.
