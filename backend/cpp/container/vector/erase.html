Erases the specified elements from the container.



1) Removes the element at pos.

2) Removes the elements in the range [first, last).

Iterators (including the end() iterator) and references to the elements at or after the point of the erase are invalidated.

The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the end() iterator (which is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

The iterator first does not need to be dereferenceable if first == last: erasing an empty range is a no-op.

[edit] Parameters





 pos



 -



 iterator to the element to remove





 first, last



 -



 the pair of iterators defining the  range of elements to remove





 Type requirements





 -If T is not MoveAssignable, the behavior is undefined.



[edit] Return value

Iterator following the last removed element.



1) If pos refers to the last element, then the end() iterator is returned.

2) If last == end() prior to removal, then the updated end() iterator is returned.

 If [first, last) is an empty range, then last is returned.

 Exceptions

Does not throw unless an exception is thrown by the assignment operator of T.



[edit] Complexity

Linear: the number of calls to the destructor of T is the same as the number of elements erased, the assignment operator of T is called the number of times equal to the number of elements in the vector after the erased elements.



[edit] Notes

When container elements need to be erased based on a predicate, rather than iterating the container and calling unary erase, the iterator range overload is generally used with std::remove()/std::remove_if() to minimise the number of moves of the remaining (non-removed) elements, — this is the erase-remove idiom.

std::erase_if() replaces the erase-remove idiom.(since C++20)



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <vector>

#include <iostream>

 

 

void print_container(const std::vector<int>& c)

{

    for (int i : c)

        std::cout << i << ' ';

    std::cout << '\n';

}

 

int main()

{

    std::vector<int> c{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};

    print_container(c);

 

    c.erase(c.begin());

    print_container(c);

 

    c.erase(c.begin() + 2, c.begin() + 5);

    print_container(c);

 

    // Erase all even numbers

    for (std::vector<int>::iterator it = c.begin(); it != c.end();)

    {

        if (*it % 2 == 0)

            it = c.erase(it);

        else

            ++it;

    }

    print_container(c);

}

Output:



0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

1 2 6 7 8 9

1 7 9
