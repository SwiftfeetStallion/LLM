void push_back( const T& value );

 (1)

(constexpr since C++20)





void push_back( T&& value );

 (2)

(since C++11) (constexpr since C++20)







Appends a copy of value to the end of the container.

If after the operation the new size() is greater than old capacity() a reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. Otherwise only the end() iterator is invalidated.

[edit] Parameters





 value



 -



 the value of the element to append













 Type requirements





 -If the following condition is met, the behavior is undefined:

1) T is not CopyInsertable into vector.

2) T is not MoveInsertable into vector.





(since C++11)



[edit] Complexity

Amortized constant.



[edit] Exceptions

If an exception is thrown (which can be due to Allocator::allocate() or element copy/move constructor/assignment), this function has no effect (strong exception guarantee).







If the move constructor of T is not noexcept and T is not CopyInsertable into *this, vector will use the throwing move constructor. If it throws, the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified.





(since C++11)



 Notes

Some implementations throw std::length_error when push_back causes a reallocation that exceeds max_size (due to an implicit call to an equivalent of reserve(size() + 1)).



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

#include <vector>

 

int main()

{

    std::vector<std::string> letters;

 

    letters.push_back("abc");

    std::string s{"def"};

    letters.push_back(std::move(s));

 

    std::cout << "std::vector letters holds: ";

    for (auto&& e : letters)

        std::cout << std::quoted(e) << ' ';

 

    std::cout << "\nMoved-from string s holds: " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';

}

Possible output:



std::vector letters holds: "abc" "def"

Moved-from string s holds: ""
