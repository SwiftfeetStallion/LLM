[edit] Cray (updated 2023-02)

 Cray C and C++ Reference Manual (8.4) For version 8.4, claims all of C++14 is supported except alignas

 Cray C and C++ Reference Manual (8.6) For version 8.6, claims all of C++14 is supported

 Cray C and C++ Reference Manual (9.1) for version 9.1 doesn't claim support beyond C++14

 HPE Cray Clang C and C++ Quick Reference (14.0) (S-2179) Versions from 11 onward (through at least 14) are based on Clang, and are generally expected to have corresponding language support. Features that entail 'interesting' code generation or linking behaviors such as coroutines or modules may lag behind, since the compiler supports generating code for GPUs and other similarly limited devices
