 Defined in header <stdexcept>











 class out_of_range;

 

 







Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that are consequence of attempt to access elements out of defined range.

It may be thrown by the member functions of std::bitset and std::basic_string, by  std::stoi and std::stod families of functions, and by the bounds-checked member access functions (e.g. std::vector::at and std::map::at).







All member functions of std::out_of_range are constexpr: it is possible to create and use std::out_of_range objects in the evaluation of a constant expression.However, std::out_of_range objects generally cannot be constexpr, because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

[edit] Member functions





 (constructor)



  constructs a new out_of_range object with the given message  (public member function)





 operator=



  replaces the out_of_range object  (public member function)







 std::out_of_range::out_of_range





out_of_range( const std::string& what_arg );

 (1)

(constexpr since C++26)





out_of_range( const char* what_arg );

 (2)

(constexpr since C++26)





out_of_range( const out_of_range& other );

 (3)

(noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26)







1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::out_of_range then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

 Parameters





 what_arg



 -



 explanatory string





 other



 -



 another exception object to copy



 Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

 Notes

Because copying std::out_of_range is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.







 std::out_of_range::operator=





out_of_range& operator=( const out_of_range& other );

 

(noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26)







Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::out_of_range then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.



 Parameters





 other



 -



 another exception object to assign with



 Return value

*this



 Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

 Member functions





  (destructor)[virtual]



  destroys the exception object  (virtual public member function of std::exception) [edit]





  what[virtual]



  returns an explanatory string  (virtual public member function of std::exception) [edit]







[edit] Notes

The standard error condition std::errc::result_out_of_range typically indicates the condition where the result, rather than the input, is out of range, and is more closely related to std::range_error and ERANGE.
