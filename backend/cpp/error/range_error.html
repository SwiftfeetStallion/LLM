 Defined in header <stdexcept>











 class range_error;

 

 







Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It can be used to report range errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation cannot be represented by the destination type).

The only standard library components that throw this exception are std::wstring_convert::from_bytes and std::wstring_convert::to_bytes.

The mathematical functions in the standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report range errors as specified in math_errhandling).







All member functions of std::range_error are constexpr: it is possible to create and use std::range_error objects in the evaluation of a constant expression.However, std::range_error objects generally cannot be constexpr, because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

[edit] Member functions





 (constructor)



  constructs a new range_error object with the given message  (public member function)





 operator=



  replaces the range_error object  (public member function)







 std::range_error::range_error





range_error( const std::string& what_arg );

 (1)

(constexpr since C++26)





range_error( const char* what_arg );

 (2)

(constexpr since C++26)





range_error( const range_error& other );

 (3)

(noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26)







1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::range_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

 Parameters





 what_arg



 -



 explanatory string





 other



 -



 another exception object to copy



 Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

 Notes

Because copying std::range_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.







 std::range_error::operator=





range_error& operator=( const range_error& other );

 

(noexcept since C++11) (constexpr since C++26)







Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::range_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.



 Parameters





 other



 -



 another exception object to assign with



 Return value

*this



 Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.
