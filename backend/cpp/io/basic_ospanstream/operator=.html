 basic_ospanstream& operator=( basic_ospanstream&& other );

 (1) 

 (since C++23) 





 basic_ospanstream& operator=( const basic_ospanstream& ) = delete;

 (2) 

 (since C++23) 







1) Move assigns the other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_ostream base class subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf.

2) Copy assignment operator is deleted. basic_ospanstream is not copy assignable.

Note that move assignment operator of the base class swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf()) between *this and other.

It is implementation-defined whether the std::basic_spanbuf wrapped in other still holds an underlying buffer after the move assignment.
