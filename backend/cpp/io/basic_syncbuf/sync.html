 protected:

int sync() override;

 

 







First, records that a flush is pending, by updating the appropriate private flag.

Then, if the current emit-on-sync policy is true, makes a call to emit().

Otherwise (if the emit-on-sync policy is false, which is the default), the flush is suspended until emit() is called, such as through std::basic_osyncstream::emit() or std::basic_osyncstream::~basic_osyncstream

[edit] Notes

sync() or its equivalent is implicitly called by close(), seekoff(), and seekpos() and explicitly called by std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()

  sync[virtual]



  synchronizes the buffers with the associated character sequence  (virtual protected member function of std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>) [edit]





  emit



  calls emit() on the underlying basic_syncbuf to transmit its internal data to the final destination  (public member function of std::basic_osyncstream<CharT,Traits,Allocator>) [edit]
