 basic_syncbuf()

    : basic_syncbuf( nullptr )

 (1) 

 





 explicit basic_syncbuf( streambuf_type* obuf )

    : basic_syncbuf( obuf, Allocator() ) {}

 (2) 

 





 basic_syncbuf( streambuf_type* obuf, const Allocator& a );

 (3) 

 





 basic_syncbuf( basic_syncbuf&& rhs );

 (4) 

 







1) Default constructor: creates an instance of std::basic_syncbuf with emit-on-sync policy set to false, wrapped streambuffer set to nullptr, and using default-constructed Allocator as the allocator for temporary storage.

2,3) Creates an instance of std::basic_syncbuf with emit-on-sync policy set to false, wrapped streambuffer set to obuf, and using a as the allocator for temporary storage.

4) Move constructor: move-constructs a std::basic_syncbuf object by moving all contents from another std::basic_syncbuf object rhs, including the temporary storage, the wrapped stream pointer, policy, and all other state (such as the mutex pointer). After move, rhs is not associated with a stream, and rhs.get_wrapped() == nullptr. The put area member pointers of the base class std::basic_streambuf of rhs are guaranteed to be null. Destroying a moved-from rhs will not produce any output.

[edit] Parameters





 obuf



 -



 pointer to the std::basic_streambuf to wrap





 a



 -



 the allocator to use for temporary storage





 rhs



 -



 another std::basic_syncbuf to move from



[edit] Exceptions

2,3) May throw std::bad_alloc from the constructor of the internal temporary storage or std::system_error from the mutex construction.

[edit] Notes

Typically called by the appropriate constructors of std::basic_osyncstream.
