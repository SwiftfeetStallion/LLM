 Defined in header <ios>











 typedef /*implementation-defined*/ streamsize;

 

 







The type std::streamsize is a signed integral type used to represent the number of characters transferred in an I/O operation or the size of an I/O buffer. It is used as a signed counterpart of std::size_t, similar to the POSIX type ssize_t.



[edit] Notes

Except in the constructors of std::strstreambuf, negative values of std::streamsize are never used.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <type_traits>

 

static_assert(std::is_signed_v<std::streamsize>);

 

int main()

{

    std::cout << sizeof(std::streamsize) << '\n';

}

Possible output:



8
