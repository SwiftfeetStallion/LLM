[edit] Parameters

(none)



[edit] Return value

true if the file stream has an associated file, false otherwise.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

 

// this file is called main.cpp

 

bool file_exists(const std::string& str)

{

    std::ifstream fs(str);

    return fs.is_open();

}

 

int main()

{

    std::boolalpha(std::cout);

    std::cout << file_exists("main.cpp")  << '\n'

              << file_exists("strange_file") << '\n';

}

Possible output:



true

false
