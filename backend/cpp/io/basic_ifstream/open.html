 void open( const std::filesystem::path::value_type* filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode



               = std::ios_base::in );

 (2) 

 (since C++17) 





 void open( const std::string& filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode



               = std::ios_base::in );

 (3) 

 (since C++11) 





 void open( const std::filesystem::path& filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode



               = std::ios_base::in );

 (4) 

 (since C++17) 







Opens and associates the file with name filename with the file stream.

Calls clear() on success. Calls setstate(failbit) on failure.



1,2) Effectively calls rdbuf()->open(filename, mode | ios_base::in) (see std::basic_filebuf::open for the details on the effects of that call). Overload (2) is only provided if std::filesystem::path::value_type is not char.(since C++17)

3,4) Effectively calls (1,2) as if by open(filename.c_str(), mode).

 Explanation





 app



 seek to the end of stream before each write





 binary



 open in binary mode





 in



 open for reading





 out



 open for writing

[edit] Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.







DR



Applied to



Behavior as published



Correct behavior





LWG 22



C++98



it was unclear how error state changes upon a successful open



the error state is unchanged





LWG 409



C++98



the error state was unchanged upon a successful open



it is cleared[1]





↑ The resolution of LWG issue #22 is overridden.
