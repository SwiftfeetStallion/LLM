 char_type widen( char c ) const;

 

 







Converts a character c to its equivalent in the current locale. The result is converted from char to character type used within the stream if needed.

Effectively calls std::use_facet< std::ctype<char_type> >(getloc()).widen(c).



[edit] Parameters





 c

 character to convert



[edit] Return value

Character converted to char_type
