[edit] 





 protected:

void set_rdbuf( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>* sb );

 

 (since C++11) 







Sets the associated stream buffer to sb without clearing the error state.

This member function is protected: it is called by the move constructors of the derived streams such as std::basic_ofstream or std::basic_istringstream, as the final step after constructing the base class and after moving the stream buffer: only the most derived stream class knows how to correctly move the stream buffer, but std::basic_ios needs to be made aware of the stream's new location so that its public member functions can access it.
