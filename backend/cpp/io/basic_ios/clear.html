 void clear( std::ios_base::iostate state = std::ios_base::goodbit );

 

 







Sets the stream error state flags by assigning them the value of state. By default, assigns std::ios_base::goodbit which has the effect of clearing all error state flags.

If rdbuf() is a null pointer (i.e. there is no associated stream buffer), then state | std::ios_base::badbit is assigned.

[edit] Parameters





 state



 -



 new error state flags setting. It can be a combination of the following constants:





 Constant



 Explanation





 goodbit



 no error





 badbit



 irrecoverable stream error





 failbit



 input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)





 eofbit



 associated input sequence has reached end-of-file







[edit] Return value

(none)



[edit] Exceptions

If the new error state includes a bit that is also included in the exceptions() mask, throws an exception of type failure.



[edit] Example

clear() without arguments can be used to unset the failbit after unexpected input; for std::cin.putback(c) see ungetc.Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

 

int main()

{

    for (char c : {'\n', '4', '1', '.', '3', '\n', 'Z', 'Y', 'X'})

        std::cin.putback(c); // emulate user's input (not portable: see ungetc Notes)

 

    double n;

    while (std::cout << "Please, enter a number: " && !(std::cin >> n))

    {

        std::cin.clear();

        std::string line;

        std::getline(std::cin, line);

        std::cout << line << "\nI am sorry, but '" << line << "' is not a number\n";

    }

    std::cout << n << "\nThank you for entering the number " << n << '\n';

}

Output:



Please, enter a number: XYZ

I am sorry, but 'XYZ' is not a number

Please, enter a number: 3.14

Thank you for entering the number 3.14
