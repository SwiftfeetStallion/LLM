 void setstate( iostate state );

 

 







Sets the stream error flags state in addition to currently set flags. Essentially calls clear(rdstate() | state). May throw an exception.

[edit] Parameters





 state



 -



 stream error state flags to set. It can be a combination of the following constants:





 Constant



 Explanation





 goodbit



 no error





 badbit



 irrecoverable stream error





 failbit



 input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)





 eofbit



 associated input sequence has reached end-of-file







[edit] Return value

(none)



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

 

int main()

{

    std::ostringstream stream;

 

    if (!stream.fail())

        std::cout << "stream is not fail\n";

 

    stream.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);

 

    if (stream.fail())

        std::cout << "now stream is fail\n";

 

    if (!stream.good())

        std::cout << "and stream is not good\n";

}

Output:



stream is not fail

now stream is fail

and stream is not good
