 public:

explicit basic_ios( std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* sb );

(3)







 private:

 public:

 (since C++11) 









Constructs a new std::basic_ios object. 



1) Default constructor. The internal state is not initialized. init() must be called before the first use of the object or before destructor, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

2) Initializes the internal state by calling init(sb). The associated stream buffer is set to sb. 

3) The copy constructor is declared private and not defined(until C++11)explicitly defined as deleted(since C++11): I/O streams are not CopyConstructible.
