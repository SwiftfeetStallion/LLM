[edit] 

The C I/O subset of the C++ standard library implements C-style stream input/output operations. The <cstdio> header provides generic file operation support and supplies functions with narrow and multibyte character input/output capabilities, and the <cwchar> header provides functions with wide character input/output capabilities.  

C streams are denoted by objects of type std::FILE that can only be accessed and manipulated through pointers of type std::FILE*. Each C stream is associated with an external physical device (file, standard input stream, printer, serial port, etc).
