 explicit basic_spanstream( std::span<CharT> s, std::ios_base::openmode mode =

                               std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

 (1) 

 (since C++23) 





 basic_spanstream( basic_spanstream&& rhs );

 (2) 

 (since C++23) 





 basic_spanstream( const basic_spanstream& ) = delete;

 (3) 

 (since C++23) 







Constructs a new basic_spanstream.



1) Uses the storage referenced by s as initial underlying buffer of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf device. The wrapped std::basic_spanbuf object is constructed as basic_spanbuf<Char, Traits>(s, mode).

2) Move constructor. Move constructs the std::basic_iostream base subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf from those of rhs, and then calls set_rdbuf with the address of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf in *this to install it.

3) Copy constructor is deleted. basic_spanstream is not copyable.

[edit] Parameters





 s



 -



 std::span referencing the storage to be use as initial underlying buffer of stream





 mode



 -



 specifies stream open mode. Following constants and bit-wise OR between them may be used:





 Constant



 Explanation





 app



 seek to the end of stream before each write





 binary



 open in binary mode





 in



 open for reading





 out



 open for writing





 trunc



 discard the contents of the stream when opening





 ate



 seek to the end of stream immediately after open





 noreplace (C++23)



 open in exclusive mode









 other



 -



 another basic_spanstream to be moved from



[edit] Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
