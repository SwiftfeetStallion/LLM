Constructs new std::istrstream and its underlying std::strstreambuf.



1,2) Constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf by calling strstreambuf(s, 0) and initializes the base class with the address of the strstreambuf. The behavior is undefined if s is not pointing at an element of a null-terminated array.

3,4) Constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf by calling strstreambuf(s, n) and initializes the base class with the address of the strstreambuf. The behavior is undefined if s is not pointing at an element of an array whose length is at least n elements.

[edit] Parameters





 s



 -



 C-string or char array to use as the contents of the stream





 n



 -



 size of the array



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <strstream>

 

int main()

{

    std::istrstream s1("1 2 3"); // string literal

    int n1, n2, n3;

    if (s1 >> n1 >> n2 >> n3)

        std::cout << n1 << ", " << n2 << ", " << n3 << '\n';

 

    char arr[] = {'4', ' ', '5', ' ', '6'};

    std::istrstream s2(arr, sizeof arr);

    if (s2 >> n1 >> n2 >> n3)

        std::cout << n1 << ", " << n2 << ", " << n3 << '\n';

}

Output:



1, 2, 3

4, 5, 6
