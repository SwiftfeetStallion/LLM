[edit] 





 basic_istringstream& operator=( basic_istringstream&& other );

 

 (since C++11) 







Move assigns the string stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_istream base class and the associated std::basic_stringbuf.

Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.
