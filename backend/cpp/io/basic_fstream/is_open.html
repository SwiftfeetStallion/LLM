[edit] Parameters

(none)



[edit] Return value

true if the file stream has an associated file, false otherwise.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>

#include <iostream>

#include <string>

 

int main()

{

    std::string filename = "some_file";

 

    std::fstream fs(filename, std::ios::in);

 

    std::cout << std::boolalpha;

    std::cout << "fs.is_open() = " << fs.is_open() << '\n';

 

    if (!fs.is_open())

    {

        fs.clear();

        fs.open(filename, std::ios::out);

        std::cout << "fs.is_open() = " << fs.is_open() << '\n';

    }

}

Possible output:



fs.is_open() = false

fs.is_open() = true
