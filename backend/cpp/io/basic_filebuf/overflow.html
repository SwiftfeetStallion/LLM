Writes some data from the put area to the associated character sequence (to the file).

Behaves like the base class version std::basic_streambuf::overflow(), except that the behavior of “consuming characters” is defined as follows:



1) First, uses std::codecvt::out of the imbued locale to convert the characters into external (possibly multibyte) representation, stored in a temporary buffer, as follows: (XSIZE is some unspecified buffer size)

const std::codecvt<CharT, char, typename Traits::state_type>& a_codecvt =

    std::use_facet<std::codecvt<CharT, char, typename Traits::state_type>>(getloc());

typename Traits::state_type state;

CharT* end;

char xbuf[XSIZE];

char* xbuf_end;

std::codecvt_base::result r =

    a_codecvt.out(state, pbase(), pptr(), end, xbuf, xbuf + XSIZE, xbuf_end);

2) Then writes all fully-converted characters from the buffer into the file. Formally, performs the following steps based on the value of r:





r



Operation





std::codecvt_base::ok



Output characters in [xbuf, xbuf_end) to the file, and fail if output fails. At this point if pbase() != pptr() and pbase() == end are both true (which means xbuf is not large enough for even one external character), then increase XSIZE and repeat from the beginning.





std::codecvt_base::partial



Output the converted external characters in [xbuf, xbuf_end) to the file, and repeat using the remaining unconverted internal characters in [end, pptr()). If output fails, fail (without repeating).





std::codecvt_base::noconv



Output characters in [pbase(), pptr()) to the file.





std::codecvt_base::error



Fail.



 If the associated file is not open (is_open() returns false), output will always fail.





3) Establishes an observable checkpoint.

 ch



 -



 the character to store in the put area



[edit] Return value

Traits::not_eof(ch) to indicate success or Traits::eof() to indicate failure.



[edit] Notes

If a_codecvt.always_noconv() returns true, the call to a_codecvt.out() may be skipped.
