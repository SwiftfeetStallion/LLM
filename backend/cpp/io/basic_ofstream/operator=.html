[edit] 





 basic_ofstream& operator=( basic_ofstream&& other );

 

 (since C++11) 







Move assigns the file stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_ostream base class and the associated std::basic_filebuf.

other is left with no associated file. Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.
