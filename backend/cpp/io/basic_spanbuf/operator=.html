[edit] 





 basic_spanbuf& operator=( basic_spanbuf&& rhs );

 (1) 

 (since C++23) 





 basic_spanbuf& operator( const basic_spanbuf& ) = delete;

 (2) 

 (since C++23) 







1) Move assignment operator. Equivalent to auto tmp{std::move(rhs)}; this->swap(tmp); return *this;. After move assignment, *this holds the state rhs held before move assignment. It is implementation-defined whether rhs still hold the underlying buffer after move assignment.

2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_spanbuf is not CopyAssignable.
