 protected:

 (since C++23) 







Makes the basic_spanbuf perform I/O on the buffer [s, s + n). Equivalently calls this->span(std::span<CharT>(s, n)) and then returns this.

This function is protected virtual, it may only be called through pubsetbuf() or from member functions of a user-defined class derived from std::basic_spanbuf.

[edit] Parameters





 s



 -



 pointer to the first CharT in the user-provided buffer





 n



 -



 the number of CharT elements in the user-provided buffer



[edit] Return value

[edit] Notes

The deprecated stream buffer std::strstreambuf or the boost.IOStreams device boost::basic_array can also implement I/O buffering over a user-provided char array.
