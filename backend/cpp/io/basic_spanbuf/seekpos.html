 protected:

pos_type seekpos( pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which =



                      std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out ) override;

 

 (since C++23) 







Repositions the next pointer to the get and/or put area, if possible, to the position indicated by sp.

Equivalent to return seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which);.

[edit] Parameters





  sp



 -



  stream position, such as one obtained by seekoff() or seekpos()





  which



 -



  defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:





  Constant



  Explanation





 in



  affect the input sequence





 out



  affect the output sequence







[edit] Return value

sp on success or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.



[edit] Notes

seekpos() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos(), which is called by the single-argument versions of std::basic_istream::seekg() and std::basic_ostream::seekp().
