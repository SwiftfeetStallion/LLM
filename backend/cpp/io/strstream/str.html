 char* str();

 

 (deprecated in C++98) (removed in C++26) 







Returns the pointer to the beginning of the buffer, after freezing it. Effectively calls rdbuf()->str().

[edit] Parameters

(none)



[edit] Return value

Pointer to the beginning of the buffer in the associated std::strstreambuf or a null pointer if no buffer is available.



 Notes

Before a call to str() that uses the result as a C-string, the stream buffer must be null-terminated. Regular output such as with stream << 1.2 does not store a null terminator, it must be appended explicitly, typically with the manipulator std::ends.

After a call to str(), dynamic streams become frozen. A call to freeze(false) is required before exiting the scope in which this strstream object was created. otherwise the destructor will leak memory. Also, additional output to a frozen stream may be truncated once it reaches the end of the allocated buffer, which may leave the buffer not null-terminated.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <strstream>

 

int main()

{

    std::strstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated output buffer

    dyn << "Test: " << 1.23; // not adding std::ends to demonstrate append behavior

    std::cout << "The output stream holds \"";

    std::cout.write(dyn.str(), dyn.pcount()) << "\"\n"; 

    // the stream is now frozen due to str()

    dyn << " More text" << std::ends;

    std::cout << "The output stream holds \"";

    std::cout.write(dyn.str(), dyn.pcount()) << "\"\n";

    dyn.freeze(false);

}

Possible output:



The stream holds "Test: 1.23"

The stream holds "Test: 1.23 More "
