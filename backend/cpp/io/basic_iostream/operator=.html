Member functions

basic_iostream::basic_iostream

basic_iostream::~basic_iostream

Protected member functions

basic_iostream::operator=

basic_iostream::swap

[edit] 





 basic_iostream& operator=( const basic_iostream& other ) = delete;

 (1) 

 





 protected:

basic_iostream& operator=( basic_iostream&& other );

 (2) 

 (since C++11) 







Assigns another stream object.



1) Copy assignment is not allowed.

2) Move assigns another stream object. Effectively calls swap(rhs). This move assignment operator is protected: it is called by the move assignment operators of the derived stream classes std::basic_stringstream and std::basic_fstream which know how to properly move-assign the associated stream buffers.
