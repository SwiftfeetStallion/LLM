 char* str();

 

 (deprecated in C++98) (removed in C++26) 







Calls freeze(), then returns a copy of start pointer of the get area, std::streambuf::eback().

The start of the get area, for all writeable std::strstreambuf objects constructed through the interface provided by std::strstream, is also the start of the put area.

[edit] Parameters

(none)



[edit] Return value

A copy of eback(), which may be a null pointer.



[edit] Notes

This function is typically called through the std::strstream interface.

The call to freeze() guarantees that the returned pointer remains valid until the next explicit call to freeze(false): otherwise (on a dynamic buffer) any output operation could trigger buffer reallocation which would invalidate the pointer. It also causes a memory leak in the destructor of std::strstreambuf, unless freeze(false) is called before the buffer (or, more commonly, the std::strstream that manages it) is destroyed.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <strstream>

 

int main()

{

    std::strstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated read/write buffer

    dyn << "Test: " << 1.23 << std::ends;

    std::strstreambuf* buf = dyn.rdbuf();

    std::cout << "R/W buffer holds [" << buf->str() // or dyn.str()

              << "]\n";

    dyn.freeze(false); // after calling .str() on a dynamic strstream

 

    char arr[10];

    std::ostrstream user(arr, 10); // fixed-size write-only buffer

    buf = user.rdbuf();

    user << 1.23 << std::ends;

    std::cout << "Write-only buffer holds [" << buf->str() // or user.str()

              << "]\n";

 

    std::istrstream lit("1 2 3"); // fixed-size read-only buffer

    buf = lit.rdbuf();

    std::cout << "Read-only buffer holds [" << buf->str() // or lit.str()

              << "]\n";

}

Output:



R/W buffer holds [Test: 1.23]

Write-only buffer holds [1.23]

Read-only buffer holds [1 2 31 2 3]
