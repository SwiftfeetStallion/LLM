 ostrstream();

 (1) 

 (deprecated in C++98) (removed in C++26) 





 ostrstream( char* s, int n, std::ios_base::openmode mode = std::ios_base::out );

 (2) 

 (deprecated in C++98) (removed in C++26) 







Constructs new output strstream and its underlying std::strstreambuf.



1) Default-constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf, which creates a dynamically growing buffer, and initializes the base class with the address of the strstreambuf member.

2) Initialized the base class with the address of the underlying std::strstreambuf member, which is initialized in one of the two possible ways, both of which write to user-provided fixed-size array:

a) if the app bit is not set in mode, constructs the buffer by calling strstreambuf(s, n, s). The behavior is undefined if there are less than n elements in the array whose first element is pointed to by s

b) if the app bit is set in mode, constructs the buffer by calling strstreambuf(s, n, s + std::strlen(s)). The behavior is undefined if there are less than n elements in the array whose first element is pointed to by s or if the array does not contain a valid null-terminated character sequence.

[edit] Parameters





 s



 -



 char array to use as the output buffer





 n



 -



 size of the array to be used as the output buffer





 mode



 -



 specifies stream open mode. It is a bitmask type, the following constants are defined (although only app is used):





 Constant



 Explanation





 app



 seek to the end of stream before each write





 binary



 open in binary mode





 in



 open for reading





 out



 open for writing





 trunc



 discard the contents of the stream when opening





 ate



 seek to the end of stream immediately after open





 noreplace (C++23)



 open in exclusive mode







[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <strstream>

 

int main()

{

    std::ostrstream s1; // dynamic buffer

    s1 << 1 << ' ' << 3.14 << " example\n" << std::ends;

    std::cout << s1.str();

    s1.freeze(false);

 

    char arr[15] = "Hello";

 

    std::ostrstream s2(arr, sizeof arr, std::ios_base::app);

    s2 << ", world!" << std::ends;

    std::cout << s2.str() << '\n';

    std::cout << arr << '\n'; // streams use the provided arrays

}

Output:



1 3.14 example

Hello, world!

Hello, world!
