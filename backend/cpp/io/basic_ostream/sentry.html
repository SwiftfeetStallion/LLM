 class sentry;

 

 







An object of class basic_ostream::sentry is constructed in local scope at the beginning of each member function of std::basic_ostream that performs output (both formatted and unformatted). Its constructor prepares the output stream: checks if the stream is already in a failed state, flushes the tie()'d output streams, and performs other implementation-defined tasks if necessary. Implementation-defined cleanup, as well as flushing of the output stream if necessary, is performed in the destructor, so that it is guaranteed to happen if exceptions are thrown during output.

[edit] Member functions





  (constructor)



  constructs the sentry object. All the preparation tasks are done here  (public member function) [edit]





  (destructor)



  finalizes the stream object after formatted output or after exception, if necessary  (public member function)





 operator=



  the assignment operator is deleted  (public member function)





  operator bool



   checks if the preparation of the stream object was successful  (public member function) [edit]







 std::basic_ostream::sentry::sentry





 explicit sentry( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os );

 

 







Prepares the stream for formatted output.

If os.good() is false, returns. Otherwise, if os.tie() is not a null pointer, calls os.tie()->flush() to synchronize the output sequence with external streams. During preparation, the constructor may call setstate(failbit) (which may throw std::ios_base::failure).

If after preparation is completed, os.good() == true, then any subsequent calls to operator bool will return true.



 Parameters





 os



 -



 output stream to prepare



 Exceptions

std::ios_base::failure if the end of file condition occurs.











 std::basic_ostream::sentry::~sentry





 ~sentry();

 

 







If (os.flags() & std::ios_base::unitbuf) && !std::uncaught_exception() && os.good()) is true, calls os.rdbuf()->pubsync(). If that function returns -1, sets badbit in os.rdstate() without propagating an exception.











 std::basic_ostream::sentry::operator bool





 explicit operator bool() const;

 

 







Checks whether the preparation of the output stream was successful.



 Parameters

(none)



 Return value

true if the preparation of the output stream was successful, false otherwise.





[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

 

struct Foo

{

    char n[6];

};

 

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, Foo& f)

{

    std::ostream::sentry s(os);

    if (s)

        os.write(f.n, 5);

    return os;

}

 

int main()

{

    Foo f = {"abcde"};

    std::cout << f << '\n';

}

Output:



abcde



[edit] Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.







DR



Applied to



Behavior as published



Correct behavior





LWG 397



C++98



the destructor might call os.flush(), which may throw exceptions



the exception is not propagated





LWG 442



C++98



operator bool was not declared const (it is const in the synopsis)



added const





LWG 835



C++98



if os sets unitbuf, the destructor would call os.flush(), whichis an UnformattedOutputFunction and creates another sentry object(whose destructor then creates another sentry object and so on)



callsos.rdbuf()->pubsync()in this case instead

  operator<<



  inserts formatted data  (public member function) [edit]
