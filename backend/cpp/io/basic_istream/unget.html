 basic_istream& unget();

 

 







Makes the most recently extracted character available again.

First, clears eofbit. Then,(since C++11) unget behaves as UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking the sentry object, if any ios_base::iostate flags are set, the function sets failbit and returns. Otherwise, calls rdbuf()->sungetc().

If rdbuf()->sungetc() returns Traits::eof(), calls setstate(badbit).

In any case, sets the gcount() counter to zero.

[edit] Parameters

(none)



[edit] Return value

*this



[edit] Exceptions



[edit]failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

 

int main()

{

    std::istringstream s1("Hello, world.");

    char c1 = s1.get();

    if (s1.unget())

    {

        char c2 = s1.get();

        std::cout << "Got: '" << c1 << "'. Got again: '" << c2 << "'.\n";

    }

}

Output:



Got: 'H'. Got again: 'H'.
