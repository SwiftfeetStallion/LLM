[edit] 





 protected:

void swap( basic_istream& rhs );

 

 (since C++11) 







Calls basic_ios::swap(rhs) to swap all data members of the base class except for rdbuf(), and swaps the values of the gcount() counters between *this and rhs. This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap functions of the swappable input stream classes std::basic_ifstream and std::basic_istringstream, which know how to correctly swap the associated streambuffers.



[edit] Parameters





 rhs



 -



 different basic_istream object of the same type to swap with



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

#include <utility>

 

int main()

{

    std::istringstream s1("hello");

    std::istringstream s2("bye");

 

    s1.swap(s2); // OK, istringstream has a public swap()

    std::swap(s1, s2); // OK, calls s1.swap(s2)

//  std::cin.swap(s2); // ERROR: swap is a protected member

 

    std::cout << s1.rdbuf() << '\n';

}

Output:



hello
