Non-member functions

operator>>(std::basic_istream)

[edit] 





 std::streamsize gcount() const;

 

 







Returns the number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.

The following member functions of basic_istream change the value of subsequent gcount() calls:



 move constructor

 swap()

 get()

 getline()

 ignore()

 read()

 readsome()

 operator>>(basic_streambuf*)



The following functions set gcount() to zero:



 constructor

 putback()

 unget()

 peek()

[edit] Parameters

[edit] Return value

The number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

 

int main()

{

    char x[20];

    std::istringstream stream("Hello World");

 

    stream.read(x, sizeof x);

    std::cout << "Characters extracted: " << stream.gcount();

}

Output:



Characters extracted: 11
