 class sentry;

 

 







An object of class basic_istream::sentry is constructed in local scope at the beginning of each member function of std::basic_istream that performs input (both formatted and unformatted). Its constructor prepares the input stream: checks if the stream is already in a failed state, flushes the tie()'d output streams, skips leading whitespace unless noskipws flag is set, and performs other implementation-defined tasks if necessary. All cleanup, if necessary, is performed in the destructor, so that it is guaranteed to happen if exceptions are thrown during input.

[edit] Member functions





  (constructor)



  constructs the sentry object. All the preparation tasks are done here  (public member function) [edit]





  (destructor)



  finalizes the stream object after formatted input or after exception, if necessary  (public member function) [edit]





 operator=[deleted]



  not copy assignable  (public member function)





  operator bool



   checks if the preparation of the stream object was successful  (public member function) [edit]







 std::basic_istream::sentry::sentry





 explicit sentry( std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>& is, bool noskipws = false );

 

 







Prepares the stream for formatted input.

If is.good() is false, calls is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) and returns. Otherwise, if is.tie() is not a null pointer, calls is.tie()->flush() to synchronize the output sequence with external streams. This call can be suppressed if the put area of is.tie() is empty. The implementation may defer the call to flush() until a call of is.rdbuf()->underflow() occurs. If no such call occurs before the sentry object is destroyed, it may be eliminated entirely.

If noskipws is zero and is.flags() & std::ios_base::skipws is nonzero, the function extracts and discards all whitespace characters until the next available character is not a whitespace character (as determined by the currently imbued locale in is). If is.rdbuf()->sbumpc() or is.rdbuf()->sgetc() returns traits::eof(), the function calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit | std::ios_base::eofbit) (which may throw std::ios_base::failure).

Additional implementation-defined preparation may take place, which may call setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) (which may throw std::ios_base::failure).

If after preparation is completed, is.good() == true, then any subsequent calls to operator bool will return true.



 Parameters





 is



 -



 input stream to prepare





 noskipws



 -



 true if whitespace should not be skipped



 Exceptions

std::ios_base::failure if the end of file condition occurs when skipping whitespace.







 std::basic_istream::sentry::~sentry





 ~sentry();

 

 







Does nothing.







 std::basic_istream::sentry::operator bool





 explicit operator bool() const;

 

 







Checks whether the preparation of the input stream was successful.



 Parameters

(none)



 Return value

true if the initialization of the input stream was successful, false otherwise.





[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

 

struct Foo

{

    char n[5];

};

 

std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, Foo& f)

{

    std::istream::sentry s(is);

    if (s)

        is.read(f.n, 5);

    return is;

}

 

int main()

{

    std::string input = "   abcde";

    std::istringstream stream(input);

    Foo f;

    stream >> f;

    std::cout.write(f.n, 5);

    std::cout << '\n';

}

Output:



abcde



[edit] Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

Behavior as published



Correct behavior





LWG 195



C++98



it was unclear whether the constructor would set eofbit



made clear





LWG 419



C++98



the constructor did not set failbit if eofbit has been set



sets failbit in this case
