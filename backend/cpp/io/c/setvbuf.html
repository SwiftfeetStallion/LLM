 Defined in header <cstdio>











 int setvbuf( std::FILE* stream, char* buffer, int mode, std::size_t size );

 

 







Changes the buffering mode of the given file stream stream as indicated by the argument mode. In addition,



 If buffer is a null pointer, resizes the internal buffer to size.

 If buffer is not a null pointer, instructs the stream to use the user-provided buffer of size size beginning at buffer. The stream must be closed (with std::fclose) before the lifetime of the array pointed to by buffer ends. The contents of the array after a successful call to std::setvbuf are indeterminate and any attempt to use it is undefined behavior.

[edit] Parameters





 stream



 -



 the file stream to set the buffer to





 buffer



 -



 pointer to a buffer for the stream to use or null pointer to change size and mode only





 mode



 -



 buffering mode to use. It can be one of the following values:





 _IOFBF



 full buffering





 _IOLBF



 line buffering





 _IONBF



 no buffering







 size



 -



 size of the buffer



[edit] Return value

​0​ on success or nonzero on failure.



[edit] Notes

This function may only be used after stream has been associated with an open file, but before any other operation (other than a failed call to std::setbuf/std::setvbuf).

Not all size bytes will necessarily be used for buffering: the actual buffer size is usually rounded down to a multiple of 2, a multiple of page size, etc.

On many implementations, line buffering is only available for terminal input streams.

A common error is setting the buffer of stdin or stdout to an array whose lifetime ends before the program terminates:



int main()

{

    char buf[BUFSIZ];

    std::setbuf(stdin, buf);

} // lifetime of buf ends, undefined behavior

The default buffer size BUFSIZ is expected to be the most efficient buffer size for file I/O on the implementation, but POSIX fstat often provides a better estimate.



[edit] Example

One use case for changing buffer size is when a better size is known.Run this code

#include <cstdio>

#include <cstdlib>

#include <iostream>

#include <sys/stat.h>

 

int main()

{

    std::FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");

    if (!fp)

    {

        std::perror("fopen");

        return EXIT_FAILURE;

    }

 

    struct stat stats;

    if (fstat(fileno(fp), &stats) == -1) // POSIX only

    {

        std::perror("fstat");

        return EXIT_FAILURE;

    }

 

    std::cout << "BUFSIZ is " << BUFSIZ << ", but optimal block size is "

              << stats.st_blksize << '\n';

    if (std::setvbuf(fp, nullptr, _IOFBF, stats.st_blksize) != 0)

    {

        std::perror("setvbuf failed"); // POSIX version sets errno

        return EXIT_FAILURE;

    }

 

    // Read entire file: use truss/strace to observe the read(2) syscalls used

    for (int ch; (ch = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF;)

    {}

 

    std::fclose(fp);

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;

}

Possible output:



BUFSIZ is 8192, but optimal block size is 65536
