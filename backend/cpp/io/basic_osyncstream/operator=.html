basic_osyncstream::~basic_osyncstream(C++20)

 basic_osyncstream& operator=( std::basic_osyncstream&& other );

 

 (since C++20) 







Move-assigns a synchronized output stream:

Move-assigns the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf from the corresponding member of other (after this move-assignment, other.get_wrapped() returns a null pointer and destruction of other produces no output; any pending buffered output will be emitted) and move-assigns the base std::basic_ostream (this swaps all stream state variables except for rdbuf between *this and other)

*this



[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>

#include <iostream>

#include <sstream>

#include <syncstream>

#include <utility>

 

int main()

{

    std::osyncstream out(std::cout);

    out << "test\n";

    std::ostringstream str_out;

    std::osyncstream{str_out} = std::move(out); // Note that out is emitted here

    std::cout << "str_out = " << std::quoted(str_out.view()) << '\n';

}

Output:



test

str_out = ""
