 class text_encoding::aliases_view

    : public ranges::view_interface<text_encoding::aliases_view>

 

 (since C++26) 







The nested class text_encoding::aliases_view is a view over aliases of the character encoding.

Let r denote an instance of aliases_view. For a non-empty range r:



 r.front() is the primary name of the registered character encoding,

 r contains the aliases of the registered character encoding such that the order of the aliases is unspecified,

 each element in r is a non-null and non-empty null-terminated byte string encoded in the literal character encoding and comprising only characters from the basic character set, and

 r does not contain duplicate values when compared with std::strcmp.



These are the following type properties of text_encoding::aliases_view:



 it models copyable, random_access_range, and borrowed_range.

 it is not required to satisfy common_range and default_initializable.

 both ranges::range_value_t<text_encoding​::​aliases_view> and ranges::range_reference_t<text_encoding::aliases_view> denote const char*.

 ranges::iterator_t<text_encoding::aliases_view> is a ConstexprIterator.

 end



  returns a sentinel of implementation-defined type of the aliases view  (public member function)
