The preprocessor is executed at translation phase 4, before the compilation. The result of preprocessing is a single file which is then passed to the actual compiler.

[edit] Directives

The preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and has the following format:



 the # character.

 a sequence of:



 a standard-defined directive name (listed below) followed by the corresponding arguments, or

 one or more preprocessing tokens where the beginning token is not a standard-defined directive name, in this case the directive is conditionally-supported with implementation-defined semantics (e.g. a common non-standard extension is the directive #warning which emits a user-defined message during compilation)(until C++23), or

 nothing, in this case the directive has no effect.





 a line break.







The module and import directives are also preprocessing directives.





(since C++20)



Preprocessing directives must not come from macro expansion.



#define EMPTY

EMPTY   #   include <file.h> // not a preprocessing directive

[edit] Capabilities

The preprocessor has the source file translation capabilities:



 conditionally compile parts of source file (controlled by directive #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, #elifdef, #elifndef(since C++23), and #endif).

 replace text macros while possibly concatenating or quoting identifiers (controlled by directives #define and #undef, and operators # and ##).

 include other files (controlled by directive #include and checked with __has_include(since C++17)).

 cause an error or warning(since C++23) (controlled by directive #error or #warning respectively(since C++23)).



The following aspects of the preprocessor can be controlled:



 implementation-defined behavior (controlled by directive #pragma and operator _Pragma(since C++11)). In addition, some compilers support (to varying degrees) the operator __pragma as a non-standard extension.

 file name and line information available to the preprocessor (controlled by directive #line).
