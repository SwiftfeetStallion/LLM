 static char_type*

    move( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );

 

 (constexpr since C++20) 







Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to the character string pointed to by dest.

Performs correctly even if the ranges [src, src + count) and [dest, dest + count) overlap.

See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::move.

LWG 7



C++98



the copy was guaranteed to perform correctly ifsrc is in [dest, dest + count), but not the otherway round (i.e. dest is in [src, src + count))
