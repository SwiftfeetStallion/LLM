Compares two characters.



1) Compares a and b for equality, behaves identically to

 static_cast<unsigned char>(a) == static_cast<unsigned char>(b), if char_type is char,

 a == b otherwise.



2) Compares a and b in such a way that they are totally ordered, behaves identically to

 static_cast<unsigned char>(a) < static_cast<unsigned char>(b), if char_type is char,

 a < b otherwise.



See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::eq and X::lt.

LWG 467



C++98



for std::char_traits<char>, the semantics of eq() and lt()are the same as the built-in == and < on char respectively[1]



changed to built-in == and< on unsigned char





↑ Most implementations call std::memcmp() for efficiency, which interprets the data as arrays of unsigned char. If char is signed on such implementations, std::char_traits<char> fails to satisfy the requirements of CharTraits.
