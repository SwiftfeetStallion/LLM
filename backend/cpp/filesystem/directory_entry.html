Non-member functions

operator<<

[edit] 





 Defined in header <filesystem>











 class directory_entry;

 

 (since C++17) 







Represents a directory entry. The object stores a path as a member and may also store additional file attributes (hard link count, status, symlink status, file size, and last write time) during directory iteration.
