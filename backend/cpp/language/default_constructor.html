 class-name



 -



 the class whose default constructor is being declared





 parameter-list



 -



 a parameter list where all parameters (except parameter packs)(since C++11) have default arguments





 function-body



 -



 the function body of the default constructor



[edit] Explanation

1) Declaration of a default constructor inside of class definition.

2-4) Definition of a default constructor inside of class definition.

3) The default constructor is explicitly-defaulted.

4) The default constructor is deleted.

5,6) Definition of a default constructor outside of class definition (the class must contain a declaration (1)).

6) The default constructor is explicitly-defaulted.

Default constructors are called during default initializations and value initializations.



[edit] Implicitly-declared default constructor

If there is no user-declared constructor or constructor template for a class type, the compiler will implicitly declare a default constructor as an inline public member of its class.

The implicitly-declared (or defaulted on its first declaration) default constructor has an exception specification as described in dynamic exception specification(until C++17) noexcept specification(since C++17).



[edit] Implicitly-defined default constructor

If the constructor is implicitly-declared(until C++11)the implicitly-declared or explicitly-defaulted default constructor is not defined as deleted(since C++11), it is implicitly-defined by the compiler when odr-used or needed for constant evaluation or when it is explicitly defaulted after its first declaration(since C++11).







If a default constructor of a union-like class T is trivial, then for each union U that is either T or an anonymous union member of T, if the first variant member (if any) of U has implicit-lifetime type, the default constructor of T begins the lifetime of that member if it is not the active member of its union.





(since C++26)



An(until C++26)Otherwise, an(since C++26) implicitly-defined default constructor has the same effect as a user-defined constructor with empty body and empty initializer list. That is, it calls the default constructors of the bases and of the non-static members of this class. Class types with an empty user-provided constructor may get treated differently than those with an implicitly-defined default constructor during value initialization.







If this satisfies the requirements of a constexpr constructor(until C++23)constexpr function(since C++23), the generated constructor is constexpr.

If some user-defined constructors are present, the user may still force the automatic generation of a default constructor by the compiler that would be implicitly-declared otherwise with the keyword default.





(since C++11)











 Deleted default constructor

The implicitly-declared or explicitly-defaulted default constructor for class T is defined as deleted if any of the following conditions is satisfied:



 T has a non-static data member of reference type without a default initializer.

 T is a non-union class and(since C++26) has a non-variant non-static non-const-default-constructible data member of const-qualified type (or possibly multidimensional array thereof) without a default member initializer.







 T is a union and all of its variant members are of const-qualified type (or possibly multidimensional array thereof).

 T is a non-union class and all members of any anonymous union member are of const-qualified type (or possibly multidimensional array thereof).





(until C++26)



 Given a class type M, T has a potentially constructed subobject obj of type M (or possibly multidimensional array thereof), and any of the following conditions is satisfied:



 M has a destructor that is deleted or inaccessible from the default constructor, and either obj is non-variant or obj has a default member initializer(since C++26).

 All following conditions are satisfied:



 obj is not a non-static data member with a default initializer.

 obj is not a variant member of a union where another non-static data member has a default initializer(until C++26).

 The overload resolution as applied to find M's default constructor does not result in a usable candidate, or in the case of obj being a variant member, selects a non-trivial function(until C++26).







If no user-defined constructors are present and the implicitly-declared default constructor is not trivial, the user may still inhibit the automatic generation of an implicitly-defined default constructor by the compiler with the keyword delete.





(since C++11)



[edit] Trivial default constructor

The default constructor for class T is trivial if all following conditions are satisfied:



 The constructor is implicitly-declared(until C++11)not user-provided(since C++11).

 T has no virtual member functions.

 T has no virtual base classes.







 T has no non-static members with default initializers.





(since C++11)



 Every direct base of T has a trivial default constructor.







 Every non-static member of class type (or array thereof) has a trivial default constructor.





(until C++26)



 Either T is a union, or every non-variant non-static member of class type (or array thereof) has a trivial default constructor.





(since C++26)



A trivial default constructor is a constructor that performs no action. All data types compatible with the C language (POD types) are trivially default-constructible.



[edit] Eligible default constructor





A default constructor is eligible if it is either user-declared or both implicitly-declared and definable.





(until C++11)



A default constructor is eligible if it is not deleted.





(since C++11)(until C++20)



A default constructor is eligible if all following conditions are satisfied:



 It is not deleted.

 Its associated constraints (if any) are satisfied.

 No default constructor whose associated constraints are satisfied is more constrained.





(since C++20)



Triviality of eligible default constructors determines whether the class is an implicit-lifetime type, and whether the class is a trivially copyable type.

[edit] Example

Run this code

struct A

{

    int x;

    A(int x = 1): x(x) {} // user-defined default constructor

};

 

struct B : A

{

    // B::B() is implicitly-defined, calls A::A()

};

 

struct C

{

    A a;

    // C::C() is implicitly-defined, calls A::A()

};

 

struct D : A

{

    D(int y) : A(y) {}

    // D::D() is not declared because another constructor exists

};

 

struct E : A

{

    E(int y) : A(y) {}

    E() = default; // explicitly defaulted, calls A::A()

};

 

struct F

{

    int& ref; // reference member

    const int c; // const member

    // F::F() is implicitly defined as deleted

};

 

// user declared copy constructor (either user-provided, deleted or defaulted)

// prevents the implicit generation of a default constructor

 

struct G

{

    G(const G&) {}

    // G::G() is implicitly defined as deleted

};

 

struct H

{

    H(const H&) = delete;

    // H::H() is implicitly defined as deleted

};

 

struct I

{

    I(const I&) = default;

    // I::I() is implicitly defined as deleted

};

 

int main()

{

    A a;

    B b;

    C c;

//  D d; // compile error

    E e;

//  F f; // compile error

the conditions where implicitly-declared default constructors aredefined as deleted did not consider multidimensional array types



consider these types

default member initializers had no effect on whethera defaulted default constructor of a union is deleted



they prevent the defaulted defaultconstructor from being deleted





CWG 2595

a default constructor was not eligible if there isanother default constructor which is more constrainedbut does not satisfy its associated constraints



it can be eligible in this case
