[edit] 

The noexcept operator performs a compile-time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions.

It can be used within a function template's noexcept specifier to declare that the function will throw exceptions for some types but not others.

[edit] Syntax











 noexcept( expression )

















Returns a prvalue of type bool. The result is true if the set of potential exceptions of the expression is empty(until C++17)expression is specified to be non-throwing(since C++17), and false otherwise.

expression is an unevaluated operand.







If expression is a prvalue, temporary materialization is applied.





(since C++17)



[edit] Notes

Even if noexcept(expr) is true, an evaluation of expr may still throw as the result of encountering undefined behavior.







If expression is of a class type or (possibly multidimensional) array thereof, temporary materialization requires the destructor be non-deleted and accessible.





(since C++17)

[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>

#include <utility>

#include <vector>

 

void may_throw();

void no_throw() noexcept;

auto lmay_throw = []{};

auto lno_throw = []() noexcept {};

 

class T

{

public:

    ~T(){} // dtor prevents move ctor

           // copy ctor is noexcept

};

 

class U

{

public:

    ~U(){} // dtor prevents move ctor

           // copy ctor is noexcept(false)

    std::vector<int> v;

};

 

class V

{

public:

    std::vector<int> v;

};

 

int main()

{

    T t;

    U u;

    V v;

 

    std::cout << std::boolalpha <<

        "may_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(may_throw()) << ")\n"

        "no_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(no_throw()) << ")\n"

        "lmay_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(lmay_throw()) << ")\n"

        "lno_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(lno_throw()) << ")\n"

        "~T() is noexcept(" << noexcept(std::declval<T>().~T()) << ")\n"

        // note: the following tests also require that ~T() is noexcept because

        // the expression within noexcept constructs and destroys a temporary

        "T(rvalue T) is noexcept(" << noexcept(T(std::declval<T>())) << ")\n"

        "T(lvalue T) is noexcept(" << noexcept(T(t)) << ")\n"

        "U(rvalue U) is noexcept(" << noexcept(U(std::declval<U>())) << ")\n"

        "U(lvalue U) is noexcept(" << noexcept(U(u)) << ")\n"

        "V(rvalue V) is noexcept(" << noexcept(V(std::declval<V>())) << ")\n"

        "V(lvalue V) is noexcept(" << noexcept(V(v)) << ")\n";

}

Output:



may_throw() is noexcept(false)

no_throw() is noexcept(true)

lmay_throw() is noexcept(false)

lno_throw() is noexcept(true)

~T() is noexcept(true)

T(rvalue T) is noexcept(true)

T(lvalue T) is noexcept(true)

U(rvalue U) is noexcept(false)

U(lvalue U) is noexcept(false)

V(rvalue V) is noexcept(true)

V(lvalue V) is noexcept(false)

Applied to



Behavior as published



Correct behavior





CWG 2722



C++17



it was unclear whether temporary materializationis applied if expression is a prvalue



it is appliedin this case





CWG 2792



C++11



the noexcept operator was required to determine whether exceptionsmay be thrown in the case of encountering undefined behavior



not required
