 Defined in header <contracts>











 class contract_violation;

 

 (since C++26) 







The class std::contracts::contract_violation defines the type of objects used to represent a contract violation that has been detected during the evaluation of a contract assertion with a particular evaluation semantic.

Objects of this type can only be created by the implementation when the contract-violation handler needs to be invoked. Users cannot create such objects directly.

[edit] Member functions





 (constructor)[deleted]



 contract_violation objects cannot be constructed by users  (public member function)





 operator=[deleted]



 contract_violation objects cannot be assigned  (public member function)





 (destructor)[possibly virtual]



  destructs the contract_violation object  (public member function)





   General contract-violation information 





 kind



  returns the kind of the contract assertion violated  (public member function)





 semantic



  returns the evaluation semantic when the contract violation occurs  (public member function)





 is_terminating



  returns whether the evaluation semantic is terminating  (public member function)





 detection_mode



  returns the reason that causes the contract violation  (public member function)





 evaluation_exception



  returns an std::exception_ptr to the exception thrown from the predicate evaulation  (public member function)





   Miscellaneous contract-violation information 





 comment



  returns the explanatory string about the contract violation  (public member function)





 location



  returns a std::source_location indicating the location of the contract violation  (public member function)







 std::contracts::contract_violation::contract_violation





 contract_violation( const contract_violation& ) = delete;

 

 (since C++26) 







The copy destructor is defined as deleted. std::contracts::contract_violation is not CopyConstructible.



 Notes

Other constructors are for internal usage only, they are not user-accessible.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::operator=





 contract_violation& operator=( const contract_violation& ) = delete;

 

 (since C++26) 







The copy assignment operator is defined as deleted. std::contracts::contract_violation is not CopyAssignable.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::~contract_violation





 /* see below */ ~contract_violation();

 

 (since C++26) 







Destructs the contract_violation object.



 Notes

It is implementation-defined whether the destructor is virtual.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::kind





 std::contracts::assertion_kind kind() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

Returns the enumerator value corresponding to the syntactic form of the violated contract assertion.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::semantic





 std::contracts::evaluation_semantic semantic() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

Returns the enumerator value corresponding to the evaluation semantic with which the violated contract assertion was evaluated.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::is_terminating





 bool is_terminating() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

If the evaluation semantic is a terminating semantic, returns true. Otherwise returns false.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::detection_mode





 std::contracts::detection_mode detection_mode() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

Returns the enumerator value corresponding to the reasons that cause the contract violation.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::evaluation_exception





 std::exception_ptr evaluation_exception() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

If the contract violation occurred because the evaluation of the predicate exited via an exception, returns an std::exception_ptr object that refers to that exception or a copy of that exception. Otherwise, returns a null std::exception_ptr object.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::comment





 const char* comment() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

Returns an implementation-defined null-terminated multibyte string in the ordinary literal encoding.



 Notes

The C++ standard recommends that the string returned should contain a textual representation of the predicate of the violated contract assertion or an empty string if storing a textual representation is undesired.







 std::contracts::contract_violation::location





 std::source_location location() const noexcept;

 

 (since C++26) 







 Return value

Returns a std::source_location object with implementation-defined value.



 Notes

The C++ standard recommends that the value returned should be a default constructed std::source_location object or a value identifying the violated contract assertion:



 When possible, if the violated contract assertion was a precondition assertion, the source location of the function invocation should be returned.

 Otherwise, the source location of the contract assertion should be returned.
