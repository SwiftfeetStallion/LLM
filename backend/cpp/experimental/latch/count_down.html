 void count_down( ptrdiff_t n = 1 );

 (1) 

 (concurrency TS) 







Atomically decrements the internal counter by n without blocking the caller.

If n is greater than the value of the internal counter or is negative, the behavior is undefined.

This operation synchronizes with all calls that block on this latch and all is_ready calls on this latch that returns true.



[edit] Parameters





 n



 -



 the value by which the internal counter is decreased



[edit] Return value

(none)



[edit] Exceptions

Throws nothing.
