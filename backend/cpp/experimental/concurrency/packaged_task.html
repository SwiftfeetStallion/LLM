[edit] 

This page is about the modified version of std::packaged_task provided by the concurrency TS supporting the std::future improvements made by that TS. For the version of packaged_task with type-erased allocator support provided by the Library Fundamentals TSes, see std::experimental::fundamentals_v2::packaged_task.

 (concurrency TS) 







std::experimental::concurrency_v1::packaged_task is a modified version of std::packaged_task provided by the concurrency TS that works with std::experimental::future.

The only change from std::packaged_task is that the get_future() member function returns a std::experimental::future<R>.
