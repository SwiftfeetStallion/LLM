 Defined in header <experimental/future>











 template< class T >

future<V /* see below */> make_ready_future( T&& value );

 (1) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 future<void> make_ready_future();

 (2) 

 (concurrency TS) 







1) If std::decay_t<T> is std::reference_wrapper<X>, then the type V is X&, otherwise, V is std::decay_t<T>.

 Creates a shared state of type V that is immediately ready, with the result constructed from std::forward<T>(value), then returns a std::experimental::future associated with that shared state.

2) Creates a shared state of type void that is immediately ready, then returns a std::experimental::future associated with that shared state.

[edit] Return value

A std::experimental::future associated with the shared state that is created.
