 Merged into ISO C++ The functionality described on this page was merged into the mainline ISO C++ standard as of 3/2016, see std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator (since C++17) 









 Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>











 template< class T >

class polymorphic_allocator;

 

 (library fundamentals TS) 







The class template std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator whose allocation behavior depends on the memory resource it is constructed with. Thus, different instances of polymorphic_allocator can exhibit entirely different allocation behavior. This runtime polymorphism allows objects using polymorphic_allocator to behave as if they used different allocator types at run time despite the identical static allocator type.
