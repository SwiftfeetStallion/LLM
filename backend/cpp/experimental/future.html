 Defined in header <experimental/future>











 template< class T > class future;

 (1) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 template< class T > class future<T&>;

 (2) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 template<> class future<void>;

 (3) 

 (concurrency TS) 







The class template std::experimental::future extends std::future with the following operations:



 an unwrapping constructor from future<future<T>>;

 a member function is_ready to query whether the associated shared state is ready; and

 a member function then to attach a continuation to the future.



However, there is no interoperation between std::experimental::future and std::future.

[edit] Member functions





  (constructor)



  construct a future object  (public member function) [edit]





  is_ready



  checks if the shared state is ready  (public member function) [edit]





  then



  attaches a continuation to a future  (public member function) [edit]





  operator=



  moves the future object  (public member function) [edit]







 Members  identical to std::future 

 Member functions

Note that share() returns a std::experimental::shared_future<T>. The behavior is otherwise identical.







  (destructor)



  destructs the future object  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]





  share



  transfers the shared state from *this to a shared_future and returns it  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]





   Getting the result 





  get



  returns the result  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]





   State 





  valid



  checks if the future has a shared state  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]





  wait



  waits for the result to become available  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]





  wait_for



  waits for the result, returns if it is not available for the specified timeout duration  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]





  wait_until



  waits for the result, returns if it is not available until specified time point has been reached  (public member function of std::future<T>) [edit]
