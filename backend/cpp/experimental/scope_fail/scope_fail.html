Creates a scope_fail from a function, a function object or another scope_fail.



1) Initializes the exit function with a function or function object, and initializes the counter of uncaught exceptions as if with std::uncaught_exceptions(). The constructed scope_fail is active.

 If Fn is not an lvalue reference type and std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<EF, Fn> is true, the stored EF is initialized with std::forward<Fn>(fn); otherwise it is initialized with fn.

 If initialization of the stored EF throws an exception, calls fn().

 This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_same_v<std::remove_cvref_t<Fn>, scope_fail> is false and std::is_constructible_v<EF, Fn> is true.

 The program is ill-formed if function call expression fn() is ill-formed.

 The behavior is undefined if calling fn() throws an exception or results in undefined behavior, even if fn has not been called.

2) Move constructor. Initializes the stored EF with the one in other, and initializes the counter of uncaught exceptions with the one in other. The constructed scope_fail is active if and only if other is active before the construction.

 If std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true, initializes stored EF (denoted by exitfun) with std::forward<EF>(other.exitfun), otherwise initializes it with other.exitfun.

 After successful move construction, other.release() is called and other becomes inactive.

 This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true or std::is_copy_constructible_v<EF> is true.

 The behavior is undefined if

 std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true and EF does not meet the requirements of MoveConstructible, or

 std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is false and EF does not meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.



3) scope_fail is not CopyConstructible.
