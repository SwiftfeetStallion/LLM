 virtual void* do_allocate( std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment );

 

 (library fundamentals TS) 







Allocates storage. 

If the current buffer has sufficient unused space to fit a block with the specified size and alignment, allocates the return block from the current buffer. 

Otherwise, this function allocates a new buffer by calling upstream_resource()->allocate(n, m), where n is not less than the greater of bytes and the next buffer size and m is not less than alignment. It sets the new buffer as the current buffer,  increases the next buffer size by an implementation-defined growth factor (which is not necessarily integral), and then allocates the return block from the newly allocated buffer.



[edit] Return value

A pointer to allocated storage of at least bytes bytes in size, aligned to the specified alignment if such alignment is supported, and to alignof(std::max_align_t) otherwise. 



[edit] Exceptions

Throws nothing unless calling allocate() on the upstream memory resource throws.
