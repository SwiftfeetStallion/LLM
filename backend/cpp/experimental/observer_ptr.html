 (library fundamentals TS v2) 







std::experimental::observer_ptr is a non-owning pointer, or observer. The observer stores a pointer to a second object, known as the watched object. An observer_ptr may also have no watched object. 

An observer is not responsible in any way for the watched object; there is no inherent relationship between an observer and the object it watches.

It is intended as a near drop-in replacement for raw pointer types, with the advantage that, as a vocabulary type, it indicates its intended use without need for detailed analysis by code readers.

Specializations of observer_ptr satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable.
