 std::experimental::shared_future<T>& operator=( const std::experimental::shared_future<T>& other );

 (1) 

 





 std::experimental::shared_future<T>& operator=( std::experimental::shared_future<T>&& other ) noexcept;

 (2) 

 







Assigns the contents of another std::experimental::shared_future object.



1) Releases any shared state and assigns the contents of other to *this. After the assignment, this->valid() == other.valid().

2) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value as other.valid() before the assignment.

[edit] Parameters





 other



 -



 a std::experimental::shared_future object to assign from



[edit] Return value

*this
