 Defined in header <experimental/barrier>











 class flex_barrier;

 

 (concurrency TS) 







The class std::experimental::flex_barrier provides a thread-coordination mechanism that allows a set of participating threads to block until an operation is completed. Unlike std::experimental::latch, barriers are reusable; once the participating threads are released from a barrier's synchronization point, they can reuse the same barrier.

A barrier has a completion phase, which is executed by one of the participating threads once all threads in the set of participating threads arrive at the synchronization point. The arrive_and_wait and arrive_and_drop calls synchronize with the start of the completion phase; the end of the completion phase synchronizes with the returns from all calls blocked by its completion.

std::experimental::flex_barrier allows the user to control the completion phase with a function object. If the function object returns -1, the set of participating threads is unchanged (and the same set of participating threads must arrive at the synchronization point in the next cycle); otherwise the set of participating threads becomes a new set with a size equal to the returned value N, and consists of the next N threads to arrive at the barrier's synchronization point.

Users who do not need this functionality can use std::experimental::barrier.
