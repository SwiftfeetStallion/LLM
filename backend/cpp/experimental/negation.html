 Merged into ISO C++ The functionality described on this page was merged into the mainline ISO C++ standard as of 2/2016, see  std::negation (since C++17) 









 Defined in header <experimental/type_traits>











 template< class B >

struct negation;

 (1) 

 (library fundamentals TS v2) 







Forms the logical negation of the type trait B.

The type negation<B> is a UnaryTypeTrait with a base characteristic of std::integral_constant<bool, !bool(B::value)>.

[edit] Template parameters





 B



 -



 any type such that the expression bool(B::value) is a valid constant expression



[edit] Helper variable template





 template< class B >

constexpr bool negation_v = negation<B>::value;

 Inherited from  std::integral_constant

 Member constants





 value[static]



 true if B has a member ::value such that !bool(B::value) is true, false otherwise   (public static member constant)





 Member functions





 operator bool



   converts the object to bool, returns value  (public member function)





 operator()(C++14)



   returns value  (public member function)
