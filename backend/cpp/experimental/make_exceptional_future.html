 Defined in header <experimental/future>











 template< class T >

future<T> make_exceptional_future( std::exception_ptr ex );

 (1) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 template< class T, class E >

future<T> make_exceptional_future( E ex );

 (2) 

 (concurrency TS) 







1) Creates a shared state of type T that is immediately ready and stores the exception pointer ex, then return a future associated with that shared state, as if by promise<T> p; p.set_exception(ex); return p.get_future();. The behavior is undefined if ex is null.

2) Creates a shared state of type T that is immediately ready and stores an exception pointer created from ex, then return a future associated with that shared state, as if by promise<T> p; p.set_exception(std::make_exception_ptr(ex)); return p.get_future();.

[edit] Return value

A future object associated with the shared state that was created.
