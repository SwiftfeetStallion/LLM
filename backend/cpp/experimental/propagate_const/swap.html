 constexpr void swap( propagate_const & pt ) noexcept(/* see below */);

 

 (library fundamentals TS v2) 







Swaps the wrapped pointer with that of pt. Let t_ designate the private data member that is the wrapped pointer-like object, then this function is equivalent to swap(t_, pt.t_), where the overload resolution for swap is performed among std::swap and any declaration found by the usual lookup rules, as described in Swappable.

The behavior is undefined if lvalues of T do not satisfy Swappable.



[edit] Parameters





 pt



 -



 another propagate_const object to swap with



[edit] Exceptions





noexcept specification:  

noexcept(noexcept(swap(t_, pt.t_)))The lookup for the identifier swap in the exception specification finds overloads described above, and does not find the member function itself, making the exception specification equivalent to C++17 std::is_nothrow_swappable.

noexcept(std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<T>)
