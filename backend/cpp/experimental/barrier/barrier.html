 explicit barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads );

 (1) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 barrier( const barrier & ) = delete;

 (2) 

 (concurrency TS) 







1) Constructs a barrier for num_threads participating threads. The set of participating threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at the synchronization point.

2) Copy constructor is deleted; barrier is not copyable.

[edit] Parameters





  num_threads



 -



  the number of participating threads for the barrier; must be non-negative



[edit]  Notes 

If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and barrier can only be destroyed.
