 void arrive_and_wait();

 

 (concurrency TS) 







Blocks and arrive at the barrier's synchronization point.

The behavior is undefined if the calling thread is not in the set of participating threads of this barrier.

Calls to arrive_and_wait synchronizes with the start of the completion phase of the barrier. The completion of the completion phase synchronizes with the return from the call.

Calls to arrive_and_drop and arrive_and_wait never introduce data races with themselves or each other.



[edit]  Notes 

It is safe for a thread to call either arrive_and_wait() or arrive_and_drop() immediately on return from this call. It's not necessary to ensure that all blocked threads have exited arrive_and_wait() before a thread calls it again.

The set of participating threads for a barrier constructed for num_threads threads is the first num_threads to arrive at its synchronization point. This set does not change from cycle to cycle, except for threads removed from the set due to arrive_and_drop() calls.



[edit]  Exceptions 

Throws nothing.
