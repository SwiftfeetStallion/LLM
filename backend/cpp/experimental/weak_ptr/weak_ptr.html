Constructs a new weak_ptr that potentially shares an object with r.



1) Default constructor. Constructs empty weak_ptr.

2) Constructs new weak_ptr which shares an object managed by r. If r manages no object, *this manages no object too. The templated overloads don't participate in overload resolution unless either Y* is implicitly convertible to T*, or Y is the type "array of N U" for some type U and some number N, and T is the type "array of unknown bound of (possibly cv-qualified) U". 

3) Move constructors. Moves a weak_ptr instance from r into *this. After this, r is empty and r.use_count() == 0. The templated overload doesn't participate in overload resolution unless either Y* is implicitly convertible to T*, or Y is the type "array of N U" for some type U and some number N, and T is the type "array of unknown bound of (possibly cv-qualified) U".
