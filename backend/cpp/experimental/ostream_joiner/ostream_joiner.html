 ostream_joiner( ostream_type& stream, const DelimT& delimiter );

 (1) 

 (library fundamentals TS v2) 





 ostream_joiner( ostream_type& stream, DelimT&& delimiter );

 (2) 

 (library fundamentals TS v2) 





 ostream_joiner( const ostream_joiner& other ) = default;

 (3) 

 (library fundamentals TS v2) (implicitly declared) 





 ostream_joiner( ostream_joiner&& other ) = default;

 (4) 

 (library fundamentals TS v2) (implicitly declared) 







1) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with delimiter, and the private "first element" flag set to true.

2) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with std::move(delimiter), and the private "first element" flag set to true.

3,4) Implicitly declared copy/move constructor that copy/move constructs the private stream pointer, delimiter, and "first element" flag members.

[edit] Parameters





 stream



 -



 the output stream to be accessed by this iterator





 delimiter



 -



 the delimiter to be inserted into the stream in between two outputs





 other



 -



 the ostream_joiner object from which this object is to be copy- or move-constructed
