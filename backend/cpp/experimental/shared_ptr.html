[edit] Member functions





  (constructor)



  constructs new shared_ptr  (public member function) [edit]





   Observers 





  get



  returns the stored pointer  (public member function) [edit]





  operator*operator->



  dereferences the stored pointer  (public member function) [edit]





  operator[]



  provides index access to the array  (public member function) [edit]





[edit] Non-member functions





  static_pointer_castdynamic_pointer_castconst_pointer_castreinterpret_pointer_cast



  applies static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, or reinterpret_cast to the stored pointer  (function template) [edit]





[edit] Helper classes





  std::hash<std::experimental::shared_ptr>



  hash support for std::experimental::shared_ptr  (class template specialization) [edit]







 Members and non-members identical to std::shared_ptr 

 Member functions

The following member functions work with std::experimental::shared_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr instead of std::weak_ptr. The behavior is otherwise identical.







  (destructor)



  destructs the owned object if no more shared_ptrs link to it  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





  operator=



  assigns the shared_ptr  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





   Modifiers 





  reset



  replaces the managed object  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





  swap



  swaps the managed objects  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





   Observers 





  use_count



  returns the number of shared_ptr objects referring to the same managed object  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





  unique(until C++20)



  checks whether the managed object is managed only by the current shared_ptr object  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





  operator bool



  checks if the stored pointer is not null  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





  owner_before



  provides owner-based ordering of shared pointers  (public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>) [edit]





 Non-member functions

These non-member functions are declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with std::experimental::shared_ptr rather than std::shared_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 function.







  make_sharedmake_shared_for_overwrite(C++20)



  creates a shared pointer that manages a new object  (function template) [edit]





  allocate_sharedallocate_shared_for_overwrite(C++20)



  creates a shared pointer that manages a new object allocated using an allocator  (function template) [edit]





  get_deleter



  returns the deleter of specified type, if owned  (function template) [edit]





  operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)



  compares with another shared_ptr or with nullptr  (function template) [edit]





  operator<<(std::shared_ptr)



  outputs the value of the stored pointer to an output stream  (function template) [edit]





  std::swap(std::shared_ptr)(C++11)



  specializes the std::swap algorithm  (function template) [edit]

  specializes atomic operations for std::shared_ptr  (function template) [edit]





 Helper class templates 

These class templates are declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with std::experimental::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr rather than std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 class template.







  owner_less(C++11)



  provides mixed-type owner-based ordering of shared and weak pointers  (class template) [edit]





  enable_shared_from_this(C++11)



  allows an object to create a shared_ptr referring to itself  (class template) [edit]
