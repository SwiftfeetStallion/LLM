 Defined in header <experimental/barrier>











 class barrier;

 

 (concurrency TS) 







The class std::experimental::barrier provides a thread-coordination mechanism that allows a set of participating threads to block until an operation is completed. Unlike std::experimental::latch, barriers are reusable; once the participating threads are released from a barrier's synchronization point, they can reuse the same barrier.

A barrier has a completion phase, which is executed by one of the participating threads once all threads in the set of participating threads arrive at the synchronization point. The arrive_and_wait and arrive_and_drop calls synchronize with the start of the completion phase; the end of the completion phase synchronizes with the returns from all calls blocked by its completion.

For std::experimental::barrier, the completion phase is empty. std::experimental::flex_barrier allows the user to control the completion phase with a function object.

The set of participating threads for a barrier constructed for num_threads threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at its synchronization point after construction. The same set of threads (except for threads that called arrive_and_drop()) must arrive at the barrier each cycle.
