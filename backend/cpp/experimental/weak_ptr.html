 (library fundamentals TS) 







std::experimental::weak_ptr is a modified version of std::weak_ptr that interoperates with std::experimental::shared_ptr and has support for arrays.

  (constructor)



  constructs new weak_ptr  (public member function) [edit]







 Members and non-members identical to std::weak_ptr 

 Member functions

The following member functions work with std::experimental::shared_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr instead of std::weak_ptr. The behavior is otherwise identical.







  (destructor)



  destroys a weak_ptr  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





  operator=



  assigns the weak_ptr  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





   Modifiers 





  reset



  releases the ownership of the managed object  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





  swap



  swaps the managed objects  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





   Observers 





  use_count



  returns the number of shared_ptr objects that manage the object  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





  expired



  checks whether the referenced object was already deleted  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





  lock



  creates a shared_ptr that manages the referenced object  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





  owner_before



  provides owner-based ordering of weak pointers  (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>) [edit]





 Non-member functions

This non-member function is declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with std::experimental::weak_ptr rather than std::weak_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 function.







  std::swap(std::weak_ptr)(C++11)



  specializes the std::swap algorithm  (function template) [edit]
