 Merged into ISO C++ The functionality described on this page was merged into the mainline ISO C++ standard as of 3/2016; see std::filesystem::directory_iterator (since C++17) 









 Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>











 class directory_iterator;

 

 (filesystem TS) 







directory_iterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates over the directory_entry elements of a directory (but does not visit the subdirectories). The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once. The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

If the directory_iterator is advanced past the last directory entry, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.

[edit] Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>

#include <fstream>

#include <iostream>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

 

int main()

{

    fs::create_directories("sandbox/a/b");

    std::ofstream{"sandbox/file1.txt"};

    std::ofstream{"sandbox/file2.txt"};

    for (const fs::directory_entry& entry : fs::directory_iterator{"sandbox"})

        std::cout << entry << '\n';

    fs::remove_all("sandbox");

}

Possible output:



"sandbox/a"

"sandbox/file1.txt"

"sandbox/file2.txt"
