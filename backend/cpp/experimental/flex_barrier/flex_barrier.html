 explicit flex_barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads );

 (1) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 template< class F >

flex_barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads, F completion );

 (2) 

 (concurrency TS) 





 flex_barrier( const flex_barrier & ) = delete;

 (3) 

 (concurrency TS) 







1) Has the same effect as flex_barrier(num_threads, c), where c is a Callable object whose invocation returns -1 and has no side effects.

2) Constructs a flex_barrier for num_threads participating threads, using completion for the completion phase. The set of participating threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at the synchronization point.

3) Copy constructor is deleted; flex_barrier is not copyable.

[edit] Parameters





 num_threads



 -



 the number of participating threads for the flex_barrier; must be non-negative





 completion



 -



 a function object controlling the completion phase; must be Callable with no arguments and return type std::ptrdiff_t, and when invoked, must return a value no less than -1 and must not throw an exception





 Type requirements





 -F must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.



[edit]  Notes 

If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and flex_barrier can only be destroyed.
