[edit] 









 Merged into ISO C++ The functionality described on this page was merged into the mainline ISO C++ standard as of 3/2016, see std::basic_string_view (since C++17) 









 Defined in header <experimental/string_view>











 template< 

    class CharT, 

    class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT> 



> class basic_string_view;

 

 (library fundamentals TS) 







The class template basic_string_view describes an object that can refer to a constant contiguous sequence of char-like objects with the first element of the sequence at position zero. 

A typical implementation holds only two members: a pointer to constant CharT and a size.

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
