 std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( std::experimental::future<T>&& other ) noexcept;

 (1) 

 





 std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( const std::experimental::future<T>& other ) = delete;

 (2) 

 







Assigns the contents of another future object.



1) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value as other.valid() before the assignment.

2) std::experimental::future is not CopyAssignable.

[edit] Parameters





 other



 -



 a std::experimental::future that will transfer state to *this



[edit] Return value

*this
