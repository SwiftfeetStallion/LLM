 future() noexcept;

 (1) 

 





 future( std::experimental::future<T>&& f ) noexcept;

 (2) 

 





 future( const std::experimental::future<T>& ) = delete;

 (3) 

 





 future( std::experimental::future<std::experimental::future<T>> && other ) noexcept;

 (4) 

 







1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty future object that does not refer to a shared state.

2) Constructs a future object, transferring the shared state held by f, if any. After construction, f.valid() is false.

3) Copy constructor is deleted. future cannot be copied.

4) Unwrapping constructor. Constructs a future object from the shared state referred to by other, if any. If other.valid() == false prior to this call, the constructed future object is empty. Otherwise, the resulting future object becomes ready when one of the following happens:

 other and other.get() are both ready. The value or exception from other.get() is stored in the shared state associated with the resulting future object.

 other is ready, but other.get() is invalid. An exception of type std::future_error with an error condition of std::future_errc::broken_promise is stored in the shared state associated with the resulting future object.



 After this constructor returns, valid() is equal to the value of other.valid() prior to this call, and other.valid() == false.
