[edit] 









 Merged into ISO C++ The functionality described on this page was merged into the mainline ISO C++ standard as of 11/2017; see std::atomic<shared_ptr<T>> (since C++20) 









 Defined in header <experimental/atomic>











 template< class T >

class atomic_shared_ptr;

 

 (concurrency TS) 







The class template atomic_shared_ptr provides thread-safe atomic pointer operations over a std::shared_ptr. It provides a better alternative to the non-member shared_ptr atomic access functions.



[edit] Member functions





  (constructor)



  constructs an atomic_shared_ptr object  (public member function) [edit]





  operator=



  stores a value into an atomic_shared_ptr object  (public member function) [edit]





  is_lock_free



  checks if the atomic_shared_ptr object is lock-free  (public member function) [edit]





  store



  atomically replaces the value of the atomic object with a non-atomic argument  (public member function) [edit]





  load



  atomically obtains the value of the atomic object  (public member function) [edit]





  operator shared_ptr<T>



  loads a value from an atomic object  (public member function) [edit]





  exchange



  atomically replaces the value of the atomic object and obtains the value held previously  (public member function) [edit]





  compare_exchange_weakcompare_exchange_strong



  atomically compares the value of the atomic object with non-atomic argument and performs atomic exchange if equal or atomic load if not  (public member function) [edit]
