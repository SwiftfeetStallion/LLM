 Defined in header <experimental/ranges/type_traits>











 template< class T, class U >

struct is_swappable_with;

 (1) 

 (ranges TS) 





 template< class T >

struct is_swappable;

 (2) 

 (ranges TS) 





 template< class T, class U >

 (ranges TS) 







1) If the expressions ranges::swap(std::declval<T>(), std::declval<U>()) and ranges::swap(std::declval<U>(), std::declval<T>()) are both well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand, provides the member constant value equal true. Otherwise, value is false. Access checks are performed as if from a context unrelated to either type. 

2) If T is not a referenceable type (i.e., possibly cv-qualified void or a function type with a cv-qualifier-seq or a ref-qualifier), provides a member constant value equal to false. Otherwise, provides a member constant value equal to ranges::is_swappable_with<T&, T&>::value.

3) Same as (1), but evaluations of both expressions from (1) are known not to throw exceptions.

4) Same as (2), but uses is_nothrow_swappable_with.

T and U shall each be a complete type, (possibly cv-qualified) void, or an array of unknown bound. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

[edit] Notes

This trait does not check anything outside the immediate context of the swap expressions: if the use of T or U would trigger template specializations, generation of implicitly-defined special member functions etc, and those have errors, the actual swap may not compile even if ranges::is_swappable_with<T,U>::value compiles and evaluates to true.
