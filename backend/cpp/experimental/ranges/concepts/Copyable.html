 Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>











 template< class T >

concept bool Copyable =

    CopyConstructible<T> &&

    Movable<T> &&



    Assignable<T&, const T&>;

 

 (ranges TS) 







The concept Copyable<T> specifies that T is an Movable object type that can also copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy assignment).



[edit] Notes

It is intended that Copyable<T> also requires Assignable<T&, const T> (assignment from const rvalue) and Assignable<T&, T&> (assignment from non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.
