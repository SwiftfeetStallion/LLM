 Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>











 template< class T >

concept bool MoveConstructible =



    Constructible<T, T> && ConvertibleTo<T, T>;

 

 (ranges TS) 







The concept MoveConstructible is satisfied if T is a reference type, or if it is an object type where an object of that type can constructed from an rvalue of that type in both direct- and copy-initialization contexts, with the usual semantics.

More precisely, if T is an object type, then MoveConstructible<T> is satisfied only if given



 rv, an rvalue of type T, and

 u2, a distinct object of type T equal to rv,



the following are true:



 After the definition T u = rv;, u is equal to u2;

 T{rv}  is equal to u2; and

 If T is not const-qualified, then rv's resulting state (after the definition/expression is evaluated in either bullets above) is valid but unspecified; otherwise, it is unchanged.
