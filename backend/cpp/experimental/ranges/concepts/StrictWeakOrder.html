 Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>











 template< class R, class T, class U >

concept bool StrictWeakOrder = Relation<R, T, U>;

 (1) 

 (ranges TS) 







The concept StrictWeakOrder<R, T, U> specifies that the Relation R imposes a strict weak ordering on its arguments. A relation r is a strict weak ordering if



 it is irreflexive: for all x, r(x, x) is false;

 it is transitive: for all a, b and c, if r(a, b) and r(b, c) are both true then r(a, c) is true;

 let e(a, b) be !r(a, b) && !r(b, a), then e is transitive: e(a, b) && e(b, c) implies e(a, c).



Under these conditions, it can be shown that e is an equivalence relation, and r induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence classes determined by e.



[edit] Notes

The distinction between Relation and StrictWeakOrder is purely semantic.
