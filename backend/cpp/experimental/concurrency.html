[edit] 

The C++ Extensions for Concurrency, ISO/IEC TS 19571:2016, defines the following new components for the C++ standard library:



Contents



1 Continuations and other extensions for std::future

2 Feature test macros

3 Merged into C++20



3.1 Latches and barriers

3.2 Atomic smart pointers









[edit] Continuations and other extensions for std::future





 Defined in header <experimental/future> 





  future(concurrency TS)



  a version of std::future enhanced with continuations and other features  (class template) [edit]





  shared_future(concurrency TS)



  a version of std::shared_future enhanced with continuations and other features  (class template) [edit]





  promise(concurrency TS)



  a modified version of std::promise that uses std::experimental::future  (class template)





  packaged_task(concurrency TS)



  a modified version of std::packaged_task that uses std::experimental::future  (class template)





  when_all(concurrency TS)



  produces a future that becomes ready when all given futures or shared_futures are ready  (function template) [edit]





  when_any(concurrency TS)



  produces a future that becomes ready when at least one of the given futures or shared_futures is ready  (function template) [edit]





  make_ready_future(concurrency TS)



  produces a future that is ready immediately and holds the given value  (function template) [edit]





  make_exceptional_future(concurrency TS)



  produces a future that is ready immediately and holds the given exception  (function template) [edit]





[edit] Feature test macros





 Defined in header <experimental/future> 





 __cpp_lib_experimental_future_continuations



  a value of at least 201505 indicates that future::then and other extensions are supported  (macro constant)





 Defined in header <experimental/latch> 





 __cpp_lib_experimental_latch



  a value of at least 201505 indicates that the latch type is supported  (macro constant)





 Defined in header <experimental/barrier> 





 __cpp_lib_experimental_barrier



  a value of at least 201505 indicates that barrier type is supported  (macro constant)





 Defined in header <experimental/atomic> 





 __cpp_lib_experimental_atomic_smart_pointers



  a value of at least 201505 indicates that the atomic smart pointers are supported  (macro constant)





[edit] Merged into C++20

The following components of the Concurrency TS have been adopted into the C++20 standard.



[edit] Latches and barriers





 Defined in header <experimental/latch> 





  latch(concurrency TS)



  single-use thread barrier  (class) [edit]





 Defined in header <experimental/barrier> 





  barrier(concurrency TS)



  reusable thread barrier  (class) [edit]





  flex_barrier(concurrency TS)



  reusable thread barrier with customizable behavior on completion  (class) [edit]





[edit] Atomic smart pointers

These class templates replace the shared_ptr atomic function overloads







 Defined in header <experimental/atomic> 





  atomic_shared_ptr(concurrency TS)



  atomic version of std::shared_ptr  (class template) [edit]





  atomic_weak_ptr(concurrency TS)



  atomic version of std::weak_ptr  (class template) [edit]
