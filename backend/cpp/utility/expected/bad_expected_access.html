 Defined in header <expected>











 template< class E >

class bad_expected_access : public std::bad_expected_access<void>

 (1) 

 (since C++23) 





 template<>

class bad_expected_access<void> : public std::exception

 (2) 

 (since C++23) 







1) Defines a type of object to be thrown by std::expected::value when accessing an expected object that contains an unexpected value. bad_expected_access<E> stores a copy of the unexpected value.

2) bad_expected_access<void> is the base class of all other bad_expected_access specializations.





All member functions of std::bad_expected_access are constexpr: it is possible to create and use std::bad_expected_access objects in the evaluation of a constant expression.However, std::bad_expected_access objects generally cannot be constexpr, because any dynamically allocated storage must be released in the same evaluation of constant expression.

  (constructor)



  constructs a bad_expected_access object  (public member function)

 std::bad_expected_access::bad_expected_access





explicit bad_expected_access( E e );

 

(since C++23) (constexpr since C++26)







Constructs a new bad_expected_access<E> object. Initializes the stored value with std::move(e).







 std::bad_expected_access::error





const E& error() const & noexcept;

 (1)

(since C++23) (constexpr since C++26)





E& error() & noexcept;

 (2)

const E&& error() const && noexcept;

 (3)

(since C++23) (constexpr since C++26)





E&& error() && noexcept;

 (4)

(since C++23) (constexpr since C++26)







Returns a reference to the stored value.







 std::bad_expected_access::what





const char* what() const noexcept override;

 

(since C++23) (constexpr since C++26)







Returns the explanatory string.



 Return value

Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g., copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.







The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.





(since C++26)



 Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().
